steps involved in a database interaction
1. Connect to a database (setup a live connection)
2. Create cursor objects to access rows & COLUMNS
3. Write all those required preset SQL queries
4. Commit to desired changes
5. close the database connection

-> its good to use capital keywords when performing SQL
----------------------------------

-> cur = conn.cursor() =  Create cursor objects to access rows & COLUMNS
-> cur.execute(
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS store (item TEXT, quantity INTEGER, price REAL)") = THIS LINE CREATES AN EMPTY DATABASE
-> conn.commit() = THIS IS COMMIT STAGE
-> conn.close() = this is closing the connection of the DATABASE
-----------------

till creation of the data and init of the data has already happened
now i will try to delete and update the data in sqlite3
---------------------------------
